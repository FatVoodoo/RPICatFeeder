RPICatFeeder
============

Raspberry Pi Cat Feeder Code Version 2.

You will need:

The most recent version of the GPIO library for python. 
 http://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Home/

This version does not need two GPIO modules to function.

This is based on the python-rpi.gpio modules version >=0.5.4-1.

You might have to manually remove the old GPIO library to get this work.
